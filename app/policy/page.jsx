          This Privacy Policy outlines the policies and procedures of Bald AI regarding the collection, use, and
          disclosure of Your information when You use the Bald AI application. We prioritize Your privacy and are
          committed to ensuring transparency about how Your information is handled. Importantly, Bald AI does not
          collect, store, or share any personal data from users.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          The Bald AI application operates entirely on Your device, meaning all data processing and analysis are done
          locally. No personal information is transmitted to our servers or any third parties. By using the Service, You
          confirm Your understanding and acceptance of this Privacy Policy. Our goal is to provide a secure and private
          experience, giving You full control over Your data.

            <strong>Personal Data</strong> refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable
            individual. However, in the context of this Application, the Company does not collect or process any

          </li>

        <h2 className="text-white text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">No Collection of Personal Data</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          The Bald AI application is designed to operate without collecting any personal data from you. All processing 
          and analysis are handled by a third-party service, with a firm guarantee that your data is deleted immediately 
          after processing, ensuring your privacy and security. The app does not transmit any additional information to 
          external servers or third parties, and no data is stored or shared by the company.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          Moreover, since the application does not collect any personal data, you can use Bald AI without the need for an 
          account or any form of registration. Your usage of the application is entirely anonymous, with no usage data or 
          metadata tracked or recorded, ensuring that your privacy is respected and protected.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          As part of the analysis, we utilize images of the front, top, left, and right sides of your face to generate a 
          result. This data is not collected, stored, or used for any purpose other than the analysis. All image data is 
          stored locally on your device, and we have no access to it. This ensures that your data is never collected or 
          stored on external servers, keeping it entirely within your control.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-white text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Security of Your Data</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          Although Bald AI does not collect any data, the security of any data on Your Device is of utmost importance.
          We strongly recommend that You take appropriate steps to secure Your Device, including keeping Your operating
          system and applications up to date, using strong passwords, and enabling encryption if available. While the
          Bald AI app itself does not interact with Your personal data, maintaining strong security practices on Your
          Device is essential to protect Your information from unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          We also advise that You regularly back up Your data to prevent loss in case of device failure. While Bald AI
          does not store any personal information, securing Your Device ensures that other personal data You may have on
          the Device remains safe. By taking these precautions, You can enhance the overall security of Your digital
          life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          Additionally, if You use the Bald AI application in environments where sensitive information is handled, such
          as shared or public devices, we recommend clearing any temporary files or cache after use. This practice
          helps ensure that no residual data is accessible to others who might use the same Device. While Bald AI does
          not store personal data, these steps further enhance Your privacy and security.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-white text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
          information from children under 13 years of age. If You are a parent or guardian and You believe that Your
          child has provided Us with personal information, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected
          personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, We will take steps
          to remove that information from our servers.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          Since Bald AI does not collect personal data, this clause is primarily precautionary. However, We remain
          committed to adhering to relevant regulations concerning children's privacy, including the Children’s Online
          Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States. If You have any concerns about the privacy of children
          using our Application, please do not hesitate to contact Us.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and to educate
          them about the importance of privacy and data security. Even though Bald AI does not collect data, fostering
          awareness about online privacy is essential in today’s digital world.

        <h2 className="text-white text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third-party
          link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of
          every site You visit, as We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy
          policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          Although Bald AI does not collect any data, the links provided within the Application may lead to websites
          that do. It is important to understand that these external websites operate independently from Bald AI and may
          have their own privacy practices. We recommend exercising caution when visiting external sites and only
          providing personal information if You are confident in the site's security and privacy measures.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party websites. Any interaction You
          have with external websites is at Your own risk, and We encourage You to familiarize Yourself with their
          privacy policies before engaging with their content or services. If You have any concerns about the links
          provided in the Bald AI Application, please contact Us for more information.

          We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal
          requirements, or other factors. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this
          page, and the "Last updated" date at the top will be revised accordingly.

          modifications. Continued use of the Bald AI Application following the posting of changes constitutes Your
          acceptance of those changes. If You do not agree with the changes, You should discontinue using the
          Application.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          While We do not anticipate significant changes to our policy of not collecting personal data, any future
          updates will continue to prioritize Your privacy and security. We are committed to maintaining a transparent
          relationship with our users and ensuring that Your data remains fully under Your control.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-white text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          Although Bald AI does not collect personal data, We want to ensure that You are aware of Your privacy rights.
          Under certain data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, You
          have specific rights related to Your personal data. These rights may include the right to access, correct,
          delete, or restrict the processing of Your personal data.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          Since Bald AI does not process personal data, these rights are not applicable within the context of this
          Application. However, if You believe that Your privacy rights have been violated in any way, We encourage You
          to contact Us to discuss Your concerns. We take privacy matters seriously and are here to address any issues
          You may have.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">
          If You are located within the European Union or other jurisdictions that grant privacy rights, and You have
          concerns about privacy beyond the scope of this Application, We recommend contacting the relevant data
          protection authority in Your region. While Bald AI operates under a strict no-data-collection policy, We
          respect the privacy rights granted to individuals under various legal frameworks.

          While We strive to protect Your privacy and maintain a secure environment, it is important to understand that
          no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. Although Bald
